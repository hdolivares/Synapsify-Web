Problem
Game dev AI is fragmented and
out-of-ﬂow
Breaking Focus

Missing Context

Slow Onboarding

Switching to external AI tools

Generated code lacks project

Onboarding new devs to Unreal is

Self-contained, agentic assistance in the editor

Context-aware of local codebase, assets, and Blueprints

Epic lowered UE royalties to 3.5% for games that also launch on Epic Games Store starting 2025—evidence of continued investment in the UE ecosystem and dev incentives. The
Verge

For non-game industries, UE moved to seat-based pricing ($1,850/seat/yr), highlighting enterprise willingness to pay for engine-native capability.

● If we targets 50k–100k Unreal pro seats globally and prices at $25–$40/seat/mo, SAM is $15–$48M ARR. (Assumptions shown for planning; actuals will depend on conversion in
indie/studio segments.)
